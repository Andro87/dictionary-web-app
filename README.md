-   [Understand how to pass data in React](https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-pass-data-from-child-to-parent-in-react-33ed99a90f43#:~:text=While%20there%20is%20no%20direct,data%20from%20the%20child%20component.) -This article helped me to improve my understanding of the Parent-Child relationship in React. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
